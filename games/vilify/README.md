Gerald, the mad scientist, has built a world destroying weapon. He then goes to the United Nations meeting and tries to make them pay him lots of money not to destroy the world. He tries to do a demonstration of his power by using his weapon to destroy Washington DC, but it doesn't work. He is laughed out of the UN meeting. Irate, he storms out and goes back to his evil lair to work on his next diabolical plan... an ice cream flavor so great that penguins would swim to his laboratory just to taste it. And much to his surprise it works... now all the worlds superheroes are attacking his lab in a last attempt to get his ice cream recipe and to stop him from controlling the world via controlling ice cream industry.
