## About Me

I'm an iOS developer since 2008, and worked as a professional Android developer for about 3 years. I started to work as a full time software / firmware developer since 2004. I have experience in leading a firmware development team with 10+ developers as well.

I started my programming life in 1990 with the BASIC language and decided to dedicate myself to it. I enjoy a lot of creative works including making video, music, and programming has always been my favorite. The best part I enjoy is architecture and user interface, and mobile development is my current favorite. I do hope I can jump into the VR scene when the hardware is ready.

I'm living in Sydney at the moment, and wish to work as a tech lead or senior developer in the US. Please [contact me](mailto:leo@superarts.org) if offering me E3 visa sponsorship is an option for your company. Any and all help would be much appreciated.

## About This Site

I decided to switch to static website recently [for some reasons](http://superarts.github.io/LSwift/lswift/intro/gossip/2015/04/30/about-lswift-blog.html), and [GitHub Pages](http://superarts.github.io) with Jekyll seems to be quite cool. I'll put most of my technical stuff here hopefully.
